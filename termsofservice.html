                Welcome to TextJet! We are so glad that you’re interested in learning about our products. This is our
                terms of service, which governs all use of the services (including websites) provided by TextJet, LLC.
                (“TextJet”). Please review it carefully. By accessing or using any of our websites or services, you are
                agreeing these terms.
                <h3><strong>1. Overview</strong></h3>
                The Terms of Service (“Terms”) applies to all access to or use of the TextJet websites, offerings, and
                services (collectively, “Services”). The Services are described in more detail in Section 3. TextJet
                provides you with these Services subject to your acceptance, without any modifications, of the Terms, as
                well as any other operating rules and policies that TextJet publishes on its website, such as our
                privacy policies (collectively, the “Agreement”). By accessing one of our Services, you represent that
                you have reached the age of majority for where you live or that you have had a parent or legal guardian
                consent to be bound by these Terms. PLEASE REVIEW THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING ONE OF
                TEXTJET'S SERVICES, YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND IT BECOMES A LEGALLY BINDING COMMITMENT
                BETWEEN YOU AND TEXTJET. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY PORTION OF THE AGREEMENT OR IF YOU DO NOT INTEND
                TO USE THE SERVICES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE ANY TEXTJET SERVICE; YOU
                SHOULD LEAVE THIS WEBSITE IMMEDIATELY BY CLOSING YOUR INTERNET BROWSER WINDOW. We reserve the right to
                change these Terms from time to time, and any revised Terms will supersede prior versions. Any updates
                to these Terms shall be posted on this website. Unless indicated otherwise, they will be effective on
                the date listed at the top of the Terms. You acknowledge your responsibility to review our Terms from
                time to time and to be aware of any such changes. By continuing to use any of the TextJer Services after
                we post any such changes, you accept the revised Terms.
                <h3><strong>2. The Parties</strong></h3>
                <span style="color: #f47020;">2.1.</span> Definitions. In this Agreement, “we,” “us,” or “our” refers to
                TextJet. “You,” “your,” and “Customer” refers to you personally, unless you are accessing or using our
                Services on behalf of an organization that does not have an existing contract with TextJet that governs
                your actions. If the latter is the case, you are accepting the Terms for that organization and
                representing that you have the authority to bind the organization to the Terms; as such, “you,” “your,”
                and “Customer” will refer to the organization. If the organization already has a separate contract with
                TextJet that covers your access and use of our Services, however, the contract will govern, as opposed
                to these Terms. <span style="color: #f47020;">2.2.</span> Affiliates. In this Agreement, an affiliate is
                an entity or person that controls a party, is controlled by a party, or is under common control with a
                party (such as a subsidiary, parent company, or employee). Each party to this Agreement will be
                responsible for the acts and omissions of their affiliates in connection with this Agreement.
                <h3><strong>3. The Services</strong></h3>
                When we refer to our Services in the Terms, we are referring to any of our platform services, including
                our programs, features, websites, account portals, and technical support. In addition to TextJet.com,
                TextJet provides Services through various other websites. The Terms apply equally to any rebranded or
                white label version of TextJet's platform services.
                <h3><strong>4. Service Availability</strong></h3>
                Services described on the TextJet Sites may or may not be available in all countries or regions of the
                world, may be available under different trademarks in different countries, and, where applicable, may be
                approved or cleared by a government regulatory body for sale or use with different indications and
                restrictions in different countries. We transmit messages initiated by you or sent to you by others
                through different routes, and the level of reliability and support for special features varies according
                to the route. You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all computer hardware, software, and
                communications equipment needed to access the Services and for paying all access charges (e.g., Internet
                Service Provider, telecommunications) incurred while using the Services. TextJet only provides that the
                Services are processed correctly and further transmitted by TextJer to the applicable network. TextJet
                is not responsible for the final delivery of any communication initiated through TextJet's Services, as
                this is out of our control and is the responsibility of downstream communications carriers. TextJet
                transmits and receives text messages and voice broadcasts via other major telecommunications companies
                and mobile network operators, and thus TextJet’s influence over the timing of the transmission of your
                messages and broadcasts is only within the technical constraints imposed upon TextJet. While TextJet
                shall use commercially reasonable efforts to transmit your messages and broadcasts to the applicable
                network for final delivery to your designated recipients as fast as possible, we cannot commit to, and
                do not guarantee, a specific maximum delivery time. Such times depend on various network and
                system-related factors among the various entities involved in the transmission of your messages and
                broadcasts across the public switched telephone network and/or Internet. You should know that
                communications carriers assign text messages and voice broadcasts with a default lifetime and any
                message or broadcast that cannot be delivered successfully within the lifetime assigned to it will be
                discarded by the communications carrier without any notice. TextJet is not liable for any loss incurred
                by the failure of a message or broadcast to be delivered, and you acknowledge that damages for financial
                or other loss resulting from delivery failure cannot be claimed from TextJet for any such
                non-deliveries. Furthermore, you agree that message and broadcast contents are deemed to have zero
                value.
                <h3><strong>5. Our Storage and Use of Your Data</strong></h3>
                <span style="color: #f47020;">5.1.</span> Privacy Policy. By accessing or using our Services, you
                acknowledge that you have reviewed and agree to the TextJet Services Privacy Policy and TextJet Sites
                Privacy Policy. If you do not accept the terms of these privacy policies, you must stop using our
                Services immediately. <span style="color: #f47020;">5.2.</span> Deletion of Your Data. While our
                platform hosts some Customer data, the continued hosting and storage of your data is not guaranteed by
                us. Except as otherwise agreed between us in writing, we may occasionally delete your data, and we will
                not be a liability for any damages, losses, or other consequences that you may incur as a result.
                <h3><strong>6. Add-ons</strong></h3>
                We may make additional features and products offered by third-parties (“Add-ons”) available on our
                Services. Your use of Add-ons available through our Services is subject to these Terms.
                <h3><strong>7. Your Account</strong></h3>
                Before you can use our Services, you must first create an account and provide us with some basic
                information, such as your full name, telephone number, email address, and account password. All
                information that you provide about yourself while maintaining a TextJet account must be accurate,
                complete, and current. You are solely responsible for all use (whether authorized or not) of our
                Services under your account(s). You are also solely responsible for all access to and use of your
                account, and for all acts and omissions of anyone that has access to it. Keep your password and let us
                know if it is compromised. If we believe you misuse our service, we can terminate your account and
                forward your information to law enforcement if appropriate. You are responsible for maintaining the
                confidentiality of your password. You agree to take all reasonable precautions to prevent unauthorized
                access to or use of our Services, and you will notify us promptly of any unauthorized access or use.
                Additionally, you agree to notify TextJet of any known or suspected unauthorized use(s) of your user
                account, or any known or suspected breach of security, including loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure
                of your username or password. We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use
                of your account. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise illegal activity related to our
                Services may be grounds for suspension or termination of your user account, in TextJet sole discretion,
                and you may be reported to appropriate law-enforcement agencies.
                <h3><strong>8. Your Use of Our Services Must Comply with the Law</strong></h3>
                You agree to use the TextJet Services in accordance with all applicable guidelines, as well as all state
                and federal laws that the Services are subject to. In order to confirm your compliance with these Terms,
                so as to ensure that TextJet is complying with national and international laws, we may, from time to
                time, periodically check the messages and broadcasts that you send. <span
                    style="color: #f47020;">8.1.</span> Representation that Communications with Your Contacts Comply
                with the Law. You represent and warrant that the owners of the phone numbers you initiate messages or
                broadcasts to through the TextJet Services have consented or otherwise opted-in to the receipt of such
                messages and broadcasts as required by any applicable law or regulation. You agree that you will include
                clear opt-out/unsubscribe information in your messages or broadcasts when required to do so by any
                applicable law or regulation, and that you will otherwise adhere to the Consumer Best Practices
                Guidelines promulgated by the Mobile Marketing Association, if it is applicable to your messages. You
                further agree that any individuals requesting Do-Not-Call (“DNC”) status shall be immediately placed on
                your DNC accounts list and you further agree that you will not initiate any further messages or
                broadcasts to any individuals after they request DNC status. <span style="color: #f47020;">8.2.</span>
                Agreement to Learn About and Comply with the Relevant Laws. You agree to familiarize yourself with and
                abide by all applicable local, state, national, and international laws and regulations pertaining to
                your use of our Services. You are solely responsible for all acts or omissions that occur under your
                account, including, without limitation, the content of the messages and broadcasts that you create and
                initiate through our Services. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), Federal Trade Commission
                and Federal Communications Commission rules, the National DNC list registry rules, and various state
                laws, rules, and regulations place restrictions on certain types of phone calls and text messages.
                Without limiting the foregoing, you agree to familiarize yourself with the legal requirements triggered
                by any messages, calls, broadcasts, and campaigns transmitted through the TextJet Services by visiting
                the following websites: Federal Trade Commission, <span style="color: #f47020;"><a

                TextJet is in no way attempting to interpret any laws, rules, or regulations. This information is
                provided merely as a courtesy, and it is not intended to replace your responsibility to familiarize

                Prohibited Uses of Our Services. You accept that our Services are provided for professional use only,
                and you agree that your use of our Services shall not include: Sending unsolicited marketing messages or
                broadcasts (i.e., spam); Sending any prohibited calls to life-line services, such as hospitals, fire,
                police, 911, or utility- related telephone numbers; Using strings of numbers, as it is unlawful to
                engage two or more lines of a multi-line business; Harvesting, or otherwise collecting, information
                about others without their consent; Misleading others as to the identity of the sender of your messages

                providing contact details that do not belong to you; Transmitting, associating, or publishing any
                unlawful, racist, harassing, defamatory, abusive, threatening, demeaning, immoral, harmful, vulgar,
                obscene, pornographic, or otherwise objectionable material of any kind; Transmitting any material that
                may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties, including trademarks, copyrights,
                and right of publicity; Transmitting any material that contains viruses, trojan horses, worms, time

                voice broadcast campaigns. TextJet will not be liable for any misuse of the Services by you. TextJet is
                not responsible for the views and opinions contained in any of your messages or broadcasts. You further

                the Services in accordance with these Terms. <span style="color: #f47020;">8.4.</span> No Intentional
                Calls to Non-RBOC Areas. You agree that you will not purposely route calls to high-cost non-RBOC
                (Regional Bell Operating Company) areas for origination or termination of telecommunications traffic on
                the TextJet system. Calls may be monitored and reported upon each billing cycle to ensure sound traffic
                patterns. TextJet will address any excessive routing of high-cost calls by a Customer, and fines may be
                assessed to recover excess charges from TextJet VoIP termination companies.

                interests necessary to provide such content to TextJet and that your provision of the content to TextJet
                does not infringe any third party’s proprietary or personal rights, including, but not limited to, any

                (other than information required for your use of the Services as contemplated herein), you grant to

                individuals acting on your behalf provide to TextJet. <span style="color: #f47020;">10.3.</span> Online
                Forums. TextJet may at its option provide you with one or more areas within the TextJet Sites for online
                discussions (e.g., a message board, wiki, chat room, or blog). Should you choose to participate in such
                a forum, you agree to not utilize the forum for illegal or inappropriate purposes. TextJet reserves the
                right, but will not be obligated, to edit or delete postings to its forums at any time and for any

                permitted to access the TextJet Services and any content provided by TextJet (which may include text,
                images, hosted software, sound files, video, or other content and which may be provided via the TextJet
                Sites or otherwise) solely for the purpose of receiving information about TextJet's business and
                products, purchasing and utilizing our Services, communicating with us, entering prize promotions
                offered by us, or as otherwise stated on the TextJet Sites. TextJet hereby grants a worldwide, fully
                paid-up, perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to you to use the TextJet Services solely
                for that purpose. We may have copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, or other intellectual
                property rights covering subject matter in the Services, including the web pages that are part of the
                Services and the TextJet Sites. Except as expressly provided in these Terms, the availability of the
                Services and the TextJet Sites does not give you any license to these patents, trademarks, copyrights,
                or other intellectual property. All copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, and other
                intellectual proprietary rights contained in the TextJet Services are the sole property of TextJet or

                that you may not copy, reproduce, retransmit, modify, alter, create any derivative works, reverse

                Millennium Copyright Act. TextJet abides by the federal Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) by
                responding to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the DMCA and other applicable laws. As
                part of our response, we may remove or disable access to material residing on a site that is controlled
                or operated by TextJet and that is claimed to be infringing, in which case we will make a good-faith
                attempt to contact the person who submitted the affected material so that they may make a counter
                notification, also in accordance with the DMCA. TextJet does not control content hosted on third party
                websites, and we cannot remove content from sites it does not own or control. If you are the copyright
                owner of content hosted on a third party site, and you have not authorized the use of your content,
                please contact the administrator of that website directly to have the content removed. Before serving
                either a Notice of Infringing Material or a Counter-Notification, you may wish to contact a lawyer to
                better understand your rights and obligations under the DMCA and other applicable laws. The following
                notice requirements are intended to comply with TextJet's rights and obligations under the DMCA and, in
                particular, section 512(c). They do not constitute legal advice. <span
                    style="color: #f47020;">11.3.</span> Filing a Notice of Infringing Material Under the DMCA. To file
                a notice of infringing material on a Site owned or controlled by TextJet, please provide a notification
                containing the following details: <span style="color: #f47020;">1.</span> Reasonably sufficient details
                to enable us to identify the work claimed to be infringed or, if multiple works are claimed to be
                infringed, a representative list          of such works (for example, the title, author, any
                registration or tracking number, and URL); <span style="color: #f47020;">2.</span> Reasonably sufficient
                detail to enable us to identify and locate the material that is claimed to be infringing (for example, a
                link to the page that contains                 the material); <span style="color: #f47020;">3.</span>
                Your contact information so that we can contact you (for example, your address, telephone number, or
                email address); <span style="color: #f47020;">4.</span> A statement that you have a good faith belief
                that the use of the material identified in (2) is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or
                the law; <span style="color: #f47020;">5.</span> A statement, under penalty of perjury, that the
                information in the notification is accurate and that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of
                the                 exclusive right that is alleged to be infringed. <span
                    style="color: #f47020;">6.</span> Your physical or electronic signature. Then, email this notice to

                    style="color: #f47020;">12.2.</span> Communications About Our Services. By creating an account with
                TextJet, you agree that TextJet may contact you via calls, text messages, or email to provide you with
                information about your account, transactions, and/or the TextJet Services requested by you. To the
                extent you have separately agreed to receive periodic text or voice alerts about products, services,
                events, special offers, or other promotional messages related to TextJet Services, TextJet may contact
                you pursuant to the terms of any such separate agreement.
                <h3><strong>13. Payments</strong></h3>
                Your use of our Services is contingent on your paying for such use (whether paid in advance or through
                the purchase of credits on the TextJet Sites), in the amounts and using the methods indicated on the
                TextJet Sites. Your payment for the Services, Credits (as defined below in Section 14), keywords, DIDs,
                usage-sensitive fees, and/or plans (a portion of which also includes software maintenance and upgrades,
                as well as customer support) shall be deemed completed when TextJet receives the full amount of payment
                owed for such Services, Credits, keywords, DIDs, usage-sensitive fees, and/or plans. You are responsible
                for paying for any message or broadcast you attempt to send to any number, regardless of whether the
                message is actually received by the intended recipient. As TextJet is dependent on other entities for
                the delivery of your messages and broadcasts, our price per credit may require adjustment in order to
                account for costs that are not in our control. Accordingly, we may adjust our prices from time to time
                and without prior notice. TextJet will charge your indicated method of payment for the Services,
                Credits, keywords, DIDs, usage-sensitive fees, and/or plans immediately upon your confirming the payment
                method and amount. Amounts to be charged may include sales and other taxes, where applicable, and any
                other amounts indicated on our Sites. TextJet will assess an additional charge based on the costs
                TextJet incurs for porting each DID number assigned to you that you request to be ported within six
                months of the original assignment by TextJet, and TextJet may further restrict your ability to port
                telephone numbers assigned to you by TextJet consistent with FCC regulations. Your account will be
                credited within 24 hours of TextJet verifying receipt of your payment. If you have elected to make a
                payment by credit card and we do not receive payment from the credit card issuer, you agree to pay all
                amounts due immediately upon demand by TextJet. TextJet cannot readily or accurately ascertain your
                location when you request to use the Services. You therefore agree that your use of the Services occurs
                in California and is subject to any applicable California taxes. To the extent that you are responsible
                for any additional taxes or fees beyond those collected by TextJet, you agree that you will pay them to
                any applicable taxing authority when due, including any interest or penalties assessed. TextJet shall
                not be responsible for any errors or transmission failures with regard to the charging and collection of
                funds from your indicated payment method, nor for any actions taken by the provider of the payment
                method you choose (which could include refusal to authorize the charge). In addition to these Terms, any
                payments made by you may be subject to the agreement between you and the provider of the payment method.
                As between you and TextJet, you are responsible for all charges related to purchases made using your
                account and payment method, whether or not you authorized such purchases. Standard charges apply to any
                test call sent originating from your account or initiated using your API key. In the event of accidental
                under billing in favor of a Customer and a Customer’s subsequent nonpayment, TextJet shall be entitled
                to immediately proceed with collection remedies and shall be entitled to recover any and all costs,
                fees, and expenses of such collection efforts, including but not limited to: collection agencies, court
                costs, filing and service of process fees, attorneys’ fees incurred from counsel of TextJet's choosing,
                or any other costs, fees, and expenses incurred in the pursuit of collection on all customer accounts
                and receivables due and payable under these Terms.
                <h3><strong>14. Credits</strong></h3>
                <span style="color: #f47020;">14.1.</span> Using Credits. Credits are paperless vouchers that you
                purchase and which facilitate the transmission of the TextJet Services selected by you. Both the chosen
                route and the destination of a message or broadcast impact the amount of credits required for each
                transmission of our Services. Additionally, the value of credits may change over time as the cost of
                transmission changes, and thus you acknowledge that the number of credits needed to utilize the Services
                may change correspondingly. The pricing information, however, will always be made known beforehand
                through the Pricing Pages on our TextJet Sites. The submission of a seemingly-valid message or broadcast
                will cause an associated quantity of credits to be debited from your account, and you can obtain the
                real-time status of your account at any time through the online interface. <span
                    style="color: #f47020;">14.2.</span> Expiration of Credits and Prepaid Minutes. Credits purchased as
                a part of a package or monthly plan (including any additional credits purchased during your monthly
                billing cycle as part of an upgrade to your plan) and not used within the month of purchase expire at
                the end of the month, unless the plan explicitly provides for a roll-over of credits. Individual
                anytime, nonmonthly plan credits purchased through your account automatically expire after 12 months
                from the date of purchase, unless otherwise stated at the time of purchase. Credits are purchased on a
                first-bought, first-to-expire basis. Any unused value shall be forfeited upon expiration. All prices,
                per-minute rates, and billing increments for credits are subject to change at any time due to
                fluctuations in market conditions. You may request a full refund of any unused, nonmonthly plan credits
                within one (1) business day of purchase. No other refunds will be given. <span
                    style="color: #f47020;">14.3.</span> Right to Offer Customized Plans. Notwithstanding the above, we
                may, in our sole discretion, offer customized plans that provide for individualized terms concerning
                credit expiration, billing cycles, account maintenance fees, and other agreed-upon terms. We reserve the
                right to do so without publicly listing the pricing for these customized plans on our Sites.
                <h3><strong>15. Fee Disputes</strong></h3>
                You must notify us in writing if you dispute any portion of any fees paid or payable by you under this
                Agreement. You must provide that written notice to us within ninety (90) days of the applicable charge,
                and we will work together with you to promptly resolve the applicable dispute. If you do not provide us
                with this written notice of your fee dispute within this 90-day period, you will not be entitled to
                dispute any fees paid or payable by you.
                <h3><strong>16. No Warranty; Limitation of Liability</strong></h3>
                TextJet reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the offering of any of the TextJet
                Services at any time and for any reason without prior notice. Further, while TextJet utilizes electronic
                and physical security to reduce the risk of improper access to or manipulation of data during
                transmission and storage, we cannot guarantee the security or integrity of the data and shall not be
                liable for breaches of security or integrity, third-party interception in transit, or any damage caused
                to your computer or other property by your use of the TextJet Services. You acknowledge that text
                messages and voice broadcasts are transmitted unencrypted and that eavesdropping of communications by
                third parties is possible. TextJet recommends that you ensure sensitive and valuable information is
                communicated by a protected and/or encrypted method. TextJet shall use commercially reasonable efforts
                to make access to the Services available through the required access protocols, but makes no warranty or
                guarantee that (i) the Services will be available at any particular time; or (ii) you will be able to
                access the Services at any particular time or from any particular location. TextJet will not be liable
                for any act or omission of any other company or companies furnishing a portion of the Services
                (including, without limitation communications carriers or ISPs); for any act or omission of a third
                party (including those vendors participating in TextJet offerings made to you); for equipment that we do
                not furnish; or for damages that result from the operation of customer-provided systems, equipment,
                facilities, or services that are interconnected with the Service. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED
                HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, THE TextJet SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT ANY
                WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING OR ANY STATEMENT
                TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THESE TERMS, TEXTJET DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE USE OF THE TEXTJET SERVICES
                WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED, TO ANY INTERRUPTIONS TO THE SERVICES
                CAUSED BY THE INTENTIONAL AND/OR MALICIOUS ACTS OF THIRD PARTIES (E.G., HACKING), NOR SHALL TEXTJET BE
                RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DATA LOSS OR LOSS OF ANY INFORMATION IN YOUR ACCOUNT, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE.
                TEXTJET ALSO MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM YOUR USE
                OF THE SERVICES OR THAT THE TEXTJET SERVICES WILL MEET ANY OF YOUR SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OTHER THAN AS
                MAY BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS. TEXTJET MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AND HEREBY
                DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, STATUTORY, OR IMPLIED,
                ORAL OR WRITTEN, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
                MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY,
                COMPLETENESS, OR TIMELINESS OF THE MATERIAL, SERVICE, SOFTWARE, TEXT, GRAPHICS OR LINKS, AND ALL
                WARRANTIES IMPLIED FROM ANY COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE, AND WARRANTIES
                RELATED TO THIRD PARTY EQUIPMENT, MATERIAL, SERVICES, OR SOFTWARE. TO THE EXTENT THIS DISCLAIMER
                CONFLICTS WITH APPLICABLE LAW, THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF ANY APPLICABLE WARRANTY WILL BE THE MINIMUM
                PERMITTED UNDER THAT LAW. TEXTJET SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT,
                INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM
                LOSS OF USE OR LOST BUSINESS, LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED
                PROFITS, LOSS OF DAMAGE TO OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL), OR FOR ANY COST OF PROCUREMENT OF
                SUBSTITUTE SERVICES ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT, TORT,
                STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHER ACTIONS, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IF
                YOUR USE OF THE TEXTJET SERVICES RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR SERVICING OR REPLACING OF EQUIPMENT, SOFTWARE,
                OR DATA, TEXTJET IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE COSTS. TEXTJET's TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE
                OF THE TEXTJET SERVICES FOR DIRECT DAMAGES SHALL NOT, IN THE AGGREGATE, EXCEED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE
                MONTHLY TRANSACTION FEE PAID BY YOU TO TEXTJET HEREUNDER.

                You warrant and represent to TextJet that you have all necessary rights, power, and authority to agree
                to these Terms and perform your obligations hereunder and that nothing contained in these Terms or in

                further warrant and represent that you are and shall at all times remain in full compliance with all
                applicable laws, rules, and regulations with regard to your use of the TextJet Services, including,
                without limitation, the TCPA, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited
                Pornography and Marketing (CAN-SPAM) Act of 2003, and all other laws and regulations concerning privacy,
                telemarketing, and Internet marketing. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless TextJet and our
                affiliates, as well as each of their respective officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents,
                contractors, representatives, content providers, and service providers, from and against any and all
                losses, claims, obligations, liabilities, damages, settlements, costs, and expenses (including, but not
                limited to, consequential damages, incidental damages, special damages, disbursements, and attorneys’
                fees, including attorneys’ fees incurred from counsel selected by TextJet in its sole discretion)
                arising from or relating to any actual or threatened claim, suit, action, proceeding, third-party
                discovery demand, governmental investigation, or enforcement action based upon or arising out of your
                activities under these Terms or your acts or omissions in connection with any use by you, an account
                belonging to you, or a computer under your control, of the TextJet Services. You acknowledge and agree
                to be held liable for any and all damages caused to TextJet by you as a direct result of any violation
                of local, state, national, or international laws or regulations, including, but not limited to, those
                damages arising from your fraudulent, intentional, or unintentional harm, disability, unauthorized use
                of, or destruction to any and all equipment, licensing, and/or services provided by TextJet to you. You
                agree to cooperate as fully as reasonably required in the defense of any claim, suit, action,
                proceeding, third-party discovery demand, governmental investigation, or enforcement action. We reserve
                the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter in which you are a
                named party and in which we would otherwise subject to indemnification by you. You will also be liable
                to us for any costs and attorneys’ fees we incur to successfully establish or enforce our right to
                indemnification under this Section.
                <h3><strong>18. Termination, Cancellation, and/or Suspension by TextJet</strong></h3>
                If you breach these Terms at any time, we may elect to suspend, terminate, and/or cancel your use of the
                Services and/or recover any damages from you arising from the event(s) giving rise to the suspension,
                termination, or cancellation. We reserve the right to suspend the Services at any time and for any
                reason we may deem necessary to continue to provide our Services in a way that may be hindered by your
                status as one of our clients, your financial status, or the content of the messages or broadcasts
                originating from you. Upon any such termination, cancellation, and/or suspension, you are still
                responsible for any obligations then accrued. Your obligation to pay all amounts accrued and owed by you
                shall continue even after any suspension or cancellation of your access to the Services (in whole or in
                part). Upon termination, for any reason, you agree to immediately cease using the Services and TextJet
                shall have no obligation to you after any termination or cancellation of these Terms. Should such a
                termination take place when you still have credits in your account, you shall receive back, at our
                discretion, a fair monetary value of such credits, save any expenses that may be incurred by TextJet,
                including, without limitation, the payment of transfer duties, legal costs, third-party costs, and
                penalties. The provisions regarding ownership, payments, warranties, and indemnifications will survive
                any suspension, termination, or cancellation of your use of our Services.
                <h3><strong>19. Termination by You</strong></h3>
                You are free to terminate or cancel your use of the Services at any time, and for any reason. If you are
                on a monthly plan or pay for monthly Keywords or DIDs, you can cancel your use of the Services by
                logging into your account, downgrading to “Pay &amp; Go,” and cancelling any Keyword or DID
                subscriptions you may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless due to a breach solely by TextJet that
                it fails to cure within thirty (30) days of its receipt of your notice, in no event shall TextJet be
                obligated to refund to you the reasonable value of any unused credits previously purchased by you.
                <h3><strong>20. Links to Other Websites</strong></h3>
                The TextJet Sites may contain links to third-party websites. These links are provided solely as a
                convenience to you and not as an endorsement by TextJet of the contents on such third-party websites.
                TextJet is not responsible for the content of linked third-party websites and does not make any
                representations regarding the content or accuracy of materials on such third-party websites. If you
                decide to access linked third-party websites, you do so at your own risk. TextJet cannot ensure that you
                will be satisfied with any products or services that you purchase from a third-party website that links
                to or from the TextJet Sites, since these websites are owned and operated by independent third parties.
                TextJet does not endorse any of the products/services, and TextJet has not taken any steps to confirm
                the accuracy or reliability of any of the information contained on such third party websites.
                Furthermore, TextJet does not make any representations or warranties as to the strength of the security
                practices for storing any information (including, without limitation, credit card and other personal
                information) you might be requested to give any third party, and you hereby irrevocably waive any claim
                against us with respect to such websites. TextJet strongly encourages you to make whatever investigation
                you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of
                these third parties. TextJet consents to your use of links to the TextJet Sites that conform to the
                following requirements. The appearance, position, and other aspects of any link to the TextJet Sites may
                neither create the false appearance that an entity or its activities or products are associated with or
                sponsored by TextJet nor be such as to damage or dilute the goodwill associated with the name and
                trademarks of TextJet or its affiliates. Moreover, TextJet reserves the right to revoke this consent to
                link at any time in its sole discretion, without notice.
                <h3><strong>21. Security Rules</strong></h3>
                You are prohibited from violating or attempting to violate the security of the TextJet Services and from
                using them to violate the security of other websites by any method, including, without limitation: (a)
                accessing data not intended for you or logging into a server or account that you are not authorized to
                access; (b) attempting to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of a system or network or to breach
                security or authentication measurers without proper authorization; (c) attempting to interfere with
                service to any user of the TextJet Services, host, or network, including, without limitation, by means
                of submitting a virus to, overloading, “flooding,” “spamming,” “mailbombing,” or “crashing” the TextJet
                Sites; (d) sending unsolicited e-mail, including promotions and/or advertisements of products or
                services; or (e) forging any TextJet packet header or any part of the header information in any e-mail,
                instant message, text message, or newsgroup posting. Violations of system or network security may result
                in civil or criminal liability. We may investigate violations of these Terms, and may involve and
                cooperate with law enforcement authorities in prosecuting TextJet Customers who are involved in such
                violations.
                <h3><strong>22. Force Majeure</strong></h3>
                TextJet shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performing our obligations hereunder, if such
                failure or delay is caused by fire, flood, earthquake, elements of nature or acts of God, acts of war,
                insurrection, terrorism, strike, failure or downtime of any telecommunications line and/or
                unavailability of any telecommunications or Internet facilities, power failure, governmental
                restrictions, any court order, compliance with any law, regulation, order of any governmental authority,
                or any other cause beyond the reasonable control of TextJet. In addition, TextJet shall be so excused in
                the event that it is unable to acquire from its usual sources, and on terms it deems to be reasonable,
                any material necessary for the performance of our Services.
                <h3><strong>23. Choice of Law</strong></h3>
                The enforceability and interpretation of Section 24 (Agreement to Arbitrate) will be determined in
                accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9. U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended (the “Federal Arbitration
                Act”), including its procedural provisions. Apart from Section 24 (Agreement to Arbitrate), the Terms
                shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive law of the State of Texas (subject
                to any applicable preemption or supersedence by U.S. federal substantive law) without regard to conflict
                of law principles that would cause laws of another jurisdiction to apply.
                <h3><strong>24. Agreement to Arbitrate</strong></h3>
                Most disputes can be resolved by contacting our Customer Support team. We strongly encourage you to
                reach out to them before you decide to bring a formal legal case. <span
                    style="color: #f47020;">24.1</span>. We Both Agree to Arbitrate. If we are not able to successfully
                work together to resolve the dispute, you (and any of your affiliates) and TextJet (and any of our
                affiliates) all agree to resolve any dispute arising under these Terms (including our privacy policies)
                or any dispute relating to our Services by binding arbitration in Austin, Texas. This agreement to
                arbitrate applies to all claims under any legal theory, including any claim that requires the
                interpretation of this document, except for the exception below in subsection 24.2 (Exception to
                Agreement to Arbitrate). This agreement also continues to apply after you have stopped using our
                Services. If we have a dispute about whether this agreement to arbitrate can be enforced or whether it
                applies to the dispute, we all agree that the arbitrator will decide that as well. In addition, if any
                of us brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated or if any of us refuses to arbitrate a claim
                that should be arbitrated, the other of us can ask a court to force us to go to arbitration to resolve
                the claim (i.e., compel arbitration). Any of us can also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an
                arbitration proceeding is ongoing. <span style="color: #f47020;">24.2.</span> Exception to Agreement to
                Arbitrate. Anything in the foregoing paragraphs to the contrary notwithstanding, TextJet may seek
                injunctive relief in any court having jurisdiction over the parties to enjoin or prevent any action you
                take or threaten to take in violation of these Terms. Moreover, you consent to the personal jurisdiction
                of these courts. <span style="color: #f47020;">24.3.</span> Arbitration Procedure. The Commercial
                Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“Rules”) then in effect shall apply to the
                arbitration, except to the extent that they conflict with any express provisions in this Section 24
                (Agreement to Arbitrate). A single independent arbitrator shall conduct the arbitration. The parties
                shall endeavor to select the independent arbitrator by mutual agreement. The arbitrator shall be a
                member of a state bar engaged in the practice of law in the United States or a retired member of a state
                or the federal judiciary in the United States. If the dispute is one to be decided by arbitration and
                such agreement cannot be reached within thirty (30) days after the dispute first arose, the selection of
                the arbitrator shall be made in accordance with the Rules as then in effect. Each party shall be
                entitled to inspect and obtain a copy of non-privileged relevant documents in the possession or control
                of the other party. All such discovery shall be in accordance with procedures approved by the
                arbitrator. Unless otherwise provided in the award, each party shall bear its own costs of discovery.
                The award of the arbitrator shall be based on the evidence admitted and shall contain an award for each
                issue and counterclaim. The award shall be made within thirty (30) days following the close of the final
                hearing and the filing of any post-hearing briefs authorized by the arbitrator. It shall set forth in
                writing the factual findings and legal reasoning for the award. The arbitrator may, in his/her
                discretion, award to any party specific performance or injunctive relief (but the foregoing is not
                intended to limit TextJet's access to the courts to the extent provided in subsection 24.2). The
                arbitrator may not change, modify, or alter any express condition, term, or provision of these Terms.
                Except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, the arbitration award will be final and binding upon
                the parties, and no appeal of any kind may be taken. Judgment may be entered thereon in any court having
                jurisdiction thereof. The statute of limitations applicable under Texas law to the commencement of a
                lawsuit shall apply to the commencement of arbitration hereunder. <span
                    style="color: #f47020;">24.4.</span> Recovery of Costs and Attorney’s Fees. In any action or
                proceeding to enforce rights under these Terms, TextJet and any of its affiliates will be entitled to
                recover costs and attorneys' fees if we substantially prevail. <span
                    style="color: #f47020;">24.5.</span> Class Action Waiver. Both you (and your affiliates) and TextJet
                (and our affiliates) agree that any claims or controversies between us must be brought against each
                other only on an individual basis. Neither you (and your affiliates) nor TextJet (and our affiliates)
                can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or
                representative action. The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person or entity’s claims into a
                single case and cannot preside over any class, consolidated, or representative proceeding (unless we
                agree otherwise). Moreover, the arbitrator’s decision or award in one person or entity’s case can only
                impact the person or entity that brought the claim, not other TextJet customers; it cannot be used to
                decide other disputes with other customers. If a court decides that this subsection 24.5 (Class Action
                Waiver) is unenforceable or invalid, then the entire Section 24 (Agreement to Arbitrate) will be null
                and void. But the rest of the Terms will still apply.
                <h3><strong>25. Entire Agreement</strong></h3>
                The Terms are only those stated herein, and they shall constitute the complete agreement between the
                parties. These Terms supersede all prior and contemporaneous proposals, statements, sales materials,
                presentations, and agreements, whether oral or written. No terms or conditions stated in or attached to
                your communications with TextJet are applicable to these Terms in any way, and they are not to be
                considered exceptions to the provisions of these Terms.
                <h3><strong>26. Severability</strong></h3>
                If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited
                or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms will otherwise remain in full force
                and effect and enforceable.
                <h3><strong>27. No Waiver</strong></h3>
                The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein will not be deemed
                a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by both parties to be
                legally binding.
                <h3><strong>28. Relationship of the Parties</strong></h3>
                You and TextJet are each independent contractors in the performance of each and every part of these
                Terms. No agency, partnership, joint venture, franchise, or employer-employee relationship is created as
                a result of these Terms. You will be solely responsible for all of your employees, agents, and your
                labor costs and expenses arising in connection them; TextJet will be solely responsible for all of our
                employees, agents, and our labor costs and expenses arising in connection with them. Likewise, you will
                be solely responsible for any and all claims, liabilities, damages, or debts of any type that arise on
                account of your activities or those of your employees or agents in the performance of these Terms;
                TextJet will be solely responsible for any and all claims, liabilities, damages, or debts of any type
                that may arise on account of our own activities or those of our employees or agents in the performance
                of these Terms. You do not have any authority of any kind to bind TextJet in any respect whatsoever, and
                you shall not attempt to do so or imply that you have the right to do so.
                <h3><strong>29. Notice</strong></h3>
                All notices that you are required to make hereunder shall be in writing. They will be deemed to have
                been duly given when received, if personally delivered; when receipt is electronically confirmed, e-mail
                at support@TextJet.com; on the day after it is sent, if sent for next-day delivery by a recognized
                overnight delivery service; and upon receipt, if sent by certified or registered mail, with return
                receipt requested. TextJet may give notice to you by means of a general notice on the TextJet Sites or
                Services, electronic mail to your e-mail address on record in TextJet's account information for you, or
                by written communication sent by personal delivery, fax, overnight courier, or certified or registered
                mail to your address on record in TextJet's account information for you.
