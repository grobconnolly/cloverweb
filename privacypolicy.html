TextJet LLC. (“TextJet”) is committed to protecting the privacy of your information. This Privacy Statement describes our information practices for our publicly-accessible websites, including our use of cookies to collect data about your use of our websites. For information about our privacy policies governing your use of TextJet’s account portal and associated platform services (“Services”), please consult our separate TextJet Services Privacy Policy.
<h3 data-fontsize="26" data-lineheight="33"><strong>1. Websites Covered</strong></h3>
In this Privacy Statement, “we,” “us,” “our,” or “TextJet” refers to TextJet and our affiliates, which includes any person or entity that controls TextJet, is controlled by TextJet, or is under common control with TextJet (such as a subsidiary, parent company, or employee).  This Privacy Statement covers TextJet’s information practices for our family of websites (collectively, “TextJet Sites”). In addition to TextJet.com, TextJet operates other white label marketing websites. This Privacy Statement applies equally to any rebranded or white label version of TextJet’s platform services.
<h3 data-fontsize="26" data-lineheight="33"><strong>2. Information TextJet Collects From You</strong></h3>
TextJet collects information from individuals who visit any of our Sites (“Visitors”), as, well as from individuals who have registered to use our platform services (“Customers”).  Some information is collected from both Visitors and Customers using commonly-used information-gathering tools. It includes standard information from your Web browser (such as browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the actions you take on the TextJet Sites (such as the Web pages viewed and the links clicked). This information is collectively called “Website Navigational Information.”  TextJet collects your Website Navigational Information using these methods:
<strong>  -&gt;  Cookies:</strong>
TextJet uses cookies to make your interactions with our Sites easy and meaningful. When you visit one of our Sites, TextJet’s servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; they merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to TextJet by, for example, responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (like a “Contact Me” or a “30-Day Free Trial” Web form), you remain anonymous when visiting our Sites.
There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer.
If you have chosen to identify yourself to TextJet, we can uniquely identify you as you navigate our Sites by using session cookies containing encrypted information. For example, each time you request a free trial or promotion by providing your contact information or each time you login to your account portal, a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to you is placed on your browser. It enables us to process your online requests and to uniquely identify who is logged into the Service. Session cookies are required to use our Services, and we do not recognize do-not-track requests for them.
TextJet uses persistent cookies that only we can read and use to identify browsers that have previously visited the TextJet Sites. When you purchase our Services or otherwise provide us with your personal information, a unique identifier associated with a persistent cookie placed on your Web browser is assigned to you. We do not respond to do-not-track requests with respect to persistent cookies.
We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies.
<strong>-&gt; Third Party Cookies:</strong>
From time-to-time, TextJet engages third parties to track and analyze nonpersonally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from Visitors and Customers who visit our Sites. TextJet also uses other third-party cookies to track the performance of our advertisements.
<strong>-&gt;  Web Beacons:</strong>
TextJet uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Customers and Visitors’ usage of our Sites and your interactions with emails that we have sent you. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you have viewed a particular Website tied to the Web beacon. For example, TextJet sometimes places Web beacons in marketing emails that notify us when you click on the link in the email that directs you to one of our TextJet Sites. TextJet uses Web beacons to operate and improve our Sites and email communications.
<strong>-&gt;  IP Addresses:</strong>
When you visit our Sites, we collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address to track and aggregate your non-personally identifiable information. For example, we use IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Customers and Visitors navigate our Sites.
The Website Navigational Information of Visitors and Customers, along with the information covered in our separate TextJet Services Privacy Policy, are collectively referred to as “User Data.”  We do not knowingly collect any personal information directly from children under the age of 16.
<h3 data-fontsize="26" data-lineheight="33"><strong>3. How TextJet Uses the Information It Collects</strong></h3>
TextJet uses Website Navigational Information to operate and improve our Sites and Services. Moreover, we use User Data in a number of different ways to improve our Services, develop new features, and to market and promote our Services. We use User Data
to perform the services requested. For example, if you fill out a “Contact Me” form on our Sites, we will use the information provided to contact you about your interest in our Services.
for marketing purposes. For example, we may use information you provide to contact you to further discuss your interest in our Services or to send you information about us and our partners, promotions, and events.
to connect our Customers with one another. For example, we may use your Customer Data to offer you the opportunity to connect with other Customers who you might know or who might share similar characteristics, such as location or industry. We may also suggest connections between Customers whose calls, messages, broadcasts, or campaigns target similar Contacts based on analyses of Customers’ Contact Data or other anonymized aggregated data.
to allow Customers to engage, interact, and communicate with one another about their uses of our Services. For example, we may give you the opportunity to notify Customers that you have connected with about your uses of our Services, and you may receive similar notifications from other Customers. These notifications may be initiated by you or by TextJet.
We may use anonymized aggregated data from any source for targeted advertising purposes, including in conjunction with third parties.
The information provided to third parties does not include your personal information, but this information may be linked to your personal information after we receive it. This Privacy Statement does not cover the use of the cookies by third parties, however, as TextJet does not control the cookies potentially used by third parties.
<h3 data-fontsize="26" data-lineheight="33"><strong>4. Security</strong></h3>
TextJet uses robust security measures to protect User Data from unauthorized access and maintain data accuracy. While TextJet utilizes electronic and physical security to reduce the risk of improper access to or manipulation of data, we cannot guarantee the security or integrity of the data and shall not be liable for breaches of security or integrity, third-party interception in transit, or any damage caused to your computer or other property by visiting TextJet Sites.
<h3 data-fontsize="26" data-lineheight="33"><strong>5. Public Forums</strong></h3>
TextJet may provide bulletin boards, blogs, or chat rooms on our Sites. Any personally identifiable information you choose to submit in such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and they may use that information to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.
<h3 data-fontsize="26" data-lineheight="33"><strong>6. Sharing of Information Collected</strong></h3>
We may share User Data with third-party service providers or others who need access to the data to perform their work on our behalf. For example, we may store User Data on third-party servers. Additionally, TextJet may share contact information that Visitors and Customers have provided to our agents so that these agents can contact you on our behalf. We do not share, sell, rent, or trade personally identifiable information with third parties for their promotional purposes.  TextJet reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information of our Customers or Visitors if required by law, if we reasonably believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process. We also reserve the right to disclose this information if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the public from harm.  If we go through a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution, or similar event, the User Data that we gather from you may be part of the assets transferred or shared in connection with the due diligence for any such transaction. Any acquirer or successor of TextJet may continue to use your data as set forth in this Privacy Statement.
<h3 data-fontsize="26" data-lineheight="33"><strong>7. Communications Preferences</strong></h3>
TextJet offers Customers and Visitors who provide contact information a way to choose how we communicate with them. You may manage your receipt of marketing and nontransactional communications by clicking here or by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of our marketing emails. Additionally, you may send a request specifying your communications preferences to <a href="mailto:support@textjet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #f46f20;">support@textjet.com</span></a>  Customers cannot opt out of receiving transactional emails related to their account with us or our Services.
<h3 data-fontsize="26" data-lineheight="33"><strong>8. Links to Third Party Websites</strong></h3>
TextJet Sites may contain links to other Websites. We are not responsible for the information practices or the content of such other Websites. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of other Websites to understand their information practices.
