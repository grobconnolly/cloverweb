                    There is no doubt it has never been a more difficult time for restaurants, hair salons, breweries,
                    and other small businesses. The question I have been asking myself is, how can we help small
                    companies struggling to survive? I have done extensive research and have spoken with several
                    business owners over the last 60 days. We have come up with three things that will help your small
                    business in the unprevented time in history.
                    <br>
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li class='liBlog'>Try and connect with your customer base:</li>
                    <p> Now more than ever, you need to be proactive with your customer outreach. Ask for your
                        customer's phone number, ask for Facebook likes, ask for Twitter follows, ask for home
                        addresses. Use every avenue available to you to connect with your customer base. Send them
                        personal thank you notes for their support. Go above and beyond to make that personal
                        connection. We have found that a short personalized video message that shows your gratitude to
                        the customer for coming in and supporting your business will have the most significant impact.
                    </p>

                    <li class='liBlog'>Be honest with your situation.</li>
                    <p>Don't be afraid to be vulnerable. If you are going through a tough time, it's ok to let people
                        know that. Showing the human component of your business will help connect your customers to you,
                        the business owner. These connections will be the driving force to keeping your business afloat
                        during these difficult times. </p>
                        <li class='liBlog'>Stay positive; you got this!</li>
                    <p>
                        You are a proud business owner! You went against the grain when everyone told you couldn't. You
                        find ways to get things done when others give up or walk away. There is no problem you can't
                        overcome. The end of this turbulent period is on the horizon. Put all your energy into keeping
                        your business going while remembering, good times are coming. You got this!
                    </p>
